On 25th August'18, [Docker](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bangalore) and [Kubernetes](https://www.meetup.com/kubernetes-openshift-India-Meetup) of Bangalore hosted a joint meetup at [J P Morgan's Bangalore office](https://www.jpmorganchase.com). More than 250 people RSVPed and ~100 people attended the meetup. 

At first [Rohan Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohan-gupta96/) talk about container orchestration with [ROOK](https://rook.io). He also covered some of the basic concepts about Software Defined Storage. Rohan is justfresh out of college, but the covered the topics very well.

We got some good feedback from the audience. I also picked up new things. Kudos [Rahul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rakrup/) and [Santa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/santa/) for taking care of all the logistics at the venue.   

In the next meetup on the 15th September'18, we will be covering [CI/CD with containers](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bangalore/events/254092188/). If you are around, then do signup.
