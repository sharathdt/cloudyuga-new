On 15th Sept'18, [Docker](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bangalore) and [Kubernetes](https://www.meetup.com/kubernetes-openshift-India-Meetup) of Bangalore hosted a joint meetup at [Rubrik's India office](https://www.rubrik.com). ~270 people RSVPed and ~80 attended the meetup.

During this meetup, the participants asked lots of questions. They did not leave our speakers during breaks and even after the meetup is over.  Though we did the live-streaming, but we got good quality video from Rubrik team, which they recorded using Zoom. Following it the recording and I am sure you would learn something new.
