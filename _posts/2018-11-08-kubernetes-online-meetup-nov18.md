On 8th Nov'18, I presented at [Kubernetes/Cloud-Native Online Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Kubernetes-Cloud-Native-Online-Meetup/). The topic of my presentation was User Authentication and Authorization in Kubernetes. Following are slide for the same :-

It was like webinar, which I have done earlier. Though we miss one to one interaction but we could reach larger audience with such meetup/events. I now kind of like the idea of doing online webinars, sessions etc. Maybe I'll do more in future. 

Thanks to the organizers for giving me the opportunity to present at the online meetup.
