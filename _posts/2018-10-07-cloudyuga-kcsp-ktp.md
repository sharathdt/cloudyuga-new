[Since inception](https://cloudyuga.guru/blog/left-red-hat-again-to-start-something-on-my-own/), our goal was to help companies and individuals embrace new age technologies; along with cloud. So far trainings had been our primary focus and I am proud to say that; we have received 100% repeat business from our clients; which kept us busy and floating :). We are now making consious efforts to expand our consulting practices as well; but with focus on just Cloud Native Technologies and Cloud.

Last month along with joining The Linux and Cloud Native Computing Foundation, we became India's first [Kubernetes Certified Service Provider](https://www.cncf.io/certification/kcsp/) and [Kubernetes Training Partner](https://www.cncf.io/certification/training/). These affirms our expertise and commitments for Cloud Native Technologies.

Getting the KCSP and KTP batch would definitely help CloudYuga to get more visibility; which is very essential at this time, as we opening up to the world. We would be the [KubeCon'18, Seattle](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2018/) and have a booth as well. 

Here, let me take a moment to thank our exceptional engineers we have in our team, [Sumit Murari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/murarisumit/) and [Vishal Ghule](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishal-ghule/), who have cleared CKA and helped us become KCSP and KTP. As we expanding our horizons, we are now looking more team members to succeed together. Take a look at our [open positions](https://cloudyuga.guru/careers/) and reach out if you or someone you know would be interested.
