It is our pleasure to announce that **CloudYuga** has joined **The [Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org) and [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/)** as silver member. Both of these foundations have played very importart role in our very existence. As mentioned in one of [earlier blog](https://cloudyuga.guru/blog/a-year-on-my-own/), after leaving my fulltime job at Red Hat; I got my first paid assignment from The Linux Foundation to build an online couse on [Cloud Infrastructure Technologies](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-cloud-infrastructure-technologies). Later I did the official [Introduction to Kubernetes](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes) course, for the CNCF. 

It is now close to 3 years, since I decided to take entrepreneurhip and formally started CloudYuga in May'16. It has been a great journey so far. Now we think, its the time has to change the gears and accelerate our involvement with community. Joining these foundations is first step. Along with this we have also become India's first [Kubernetes Certified Service Provider](https://www.cncf.io/certification/kcsp/) and [Kubernetes Training Partner](https://www.cncf.io/certification/training/). We'll put more details in another blog post. 

Also we are a startup sponsor at [KubeCon'18, Seattle](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2018/).

With this we now start a new journey. Wish us good luck :) !!
